## Microsoft Defender for Storage – Price Estimation Script

> ## Important note
>  
A new pricing plan is now available for Microsoft Defender for Cloud that charges you according to the number of storage accounts it protects (per-storage). The cost in the legacy pricing plan increases according to the number of analyzed transactions in the storage account (per-transaction). The new per-storage plan fixes costs per storage account but accounts with an exceptionally high transaction volume incur an overage charge. For details about the pricing plans, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/)

> The new per-storage plan is only supported on public clouds, and can be enabled only at the subscription level.

Microsoft Defender for Storage is an Azure-native layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your storage accounts. It uses advanced threat detection capabilities and [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684) data to provide contextual security alerts. Those alerts also include steps to mitigate the detected threats and prevent future attacks.

Microsoft Defender for Storage continuously analyzes the transactions of [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/), [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/), and [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/) services. When potentially malicious activities are detected, security alerts are generated. Alerts are shown in Microsoft Defender for Cloud with the details of the suspicious activity, appropriate investigation steps, remediation actions, and security recommendations. [Learn more about the capabilities here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-storage-introduction).

These PowerShell scripts allow you to estimate the cost of the new per-storage pricing plan and it considers all storage accounts with and without Microsoft Defender for Storage enabled across the selected scope.

D4Storage-PricingEstimation-Per-Storage.ps1 executes in serial across each subscription and storage account whereas D4Storage-PricingEstimation-Per-Storage-Parallel.ps1 iterates over each subscription and storage account in parallel.

The results are derived from data extracted from the past month, and the estimation is for the monthly cost. 
>At the end of the script execution CSV file (DefenderEstimatedCostBySubscription.csv) will be saved in the current directory.
